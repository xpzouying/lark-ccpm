# Execute — Start Building with Parallel Agents

This phase covers analyzing tasks for parallel work streams and launching agents to execute them.

---

## Task Analysis

**Trigger**: User wants to understand how to parallelize work on a task before starting.

### Preflight
- Find the local task file: check `.claude/epics/*/<N>.md` first, then search for `lark_record:` in frontmatter.
- If not found: "❌ No local task for task #<N>. Run a sync first."

### Process

Get task details:
```bash
APP_TOKEN=$(grep 'app_token:' .claude/lark-ccpm.yml | awk '{print $2}')
TABLE_ID=$(grep 'table_id:' .claude/lark-ccpm.yml | awk '{print $2}')
RECORD_ID=$(grep 'lark_record:' .claude/epics/*/<N>.md | awk '{print $2}')
lark-cli base +record-get --base-token "$APP_TOKEN" --table-id "$TABLE_ID" --record-id "$RECORD_ID"
```

Read the local task file fully. Identify independent work streams by asking:
- Which files will be created/modified?
- Which changes can happen simultaneously without conflict?
- What are the dependencies between changes?

**Common stream patterns:**
- Database Layer: schema, migrations, models
- Service Layer: business logic, data access
- API Layer: endpoints, validation, middleware
- UI Layer: components, pages, styles
- Test Layer: unit tests, integration tests

Create `.claude/epics/<epic_name>/<N>-analysis.md`:

```markdown
---
task: <N>
lark_record: <record_id>
title: <title>
analyzed: <run: date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ">
estimated_hours: <total>
parallelization_factor: <1.0-5.0>

# Parallel Work Analysis: Task <N>

## Overview

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: <Name>
**Scope**: 
**Files**: 
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: <Name>
**Scope**: 
**Files**: 
**Can Start**: after Stream A
**Dependencies**: Stream A

## Coordination Points
### Shared Files
### Sequential Requirements

## Conflict Risk Assessment

## Parallelization Strategy

## Expected Timeline
- With parallel execution: <max_stream_hours>h wall time
- Without: <sum_all_hours>h
- Efficiency gain: <pct>%
```

**Output**: "✅ Analysis complete for task #<N> — N parallel streams identified. Ready to start? Say: start task <N>"

---

## Starting a Task

**Trigger**: User wants to begin work on a specific task.

### Preflight
1. Verify task exists and is open by reading frontmatter `lark_record:` from the local task file, then:
   ```bash
   APP_TOKEN=$(grep 'app_token:' .claude/lark-ccpm.yml | awk '{print $2}')
   TABLE_ID=$(grep 'table_id:' .claude/lark-ccpm.yml | awk '{print $2}')
   RECORD_ID=$(grep 'lark_record:' .claude/epics/*/<N>.md | awk '{print $2}')
   lark-cli base +record-get --base-token "$APP_TOKEN" --table-id "$TABLE_ID" --record-id "$RECORD_ID"
   ```
2. Find local task file (as above).
3. Check for analysis file: `.claude/epics/*/<N>-analysis.md` — if missing, run analysis first (or do both in sequence: analyze then start).
4. Verify epic worktree exists: `git worktree list | grep "epic-<name>"` — if not: "❌ No worktree. Sync the epic first."

### Process

**Step 1 — Read the analysis**, identify which streams can start immediately vs. which have dependencies.

**Step 2 — Create progress tracking:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/epics/<epic>/updates/<N>
current_date=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
```

Create `.claude/epics/<epic>/updates/<N>/stream-<X>.md` for each stream:
```markdown
---
task: <N>
lark_record: <record_id>
stream: <stream_name>
started: <datetime>
status: in_progress
---
## Scope
## Progress
- Starting implementation
```

**Step 3 — Launch parallel agents** for each stream that can start immediately:

```yaml
Task:
  description: "Task #<N> Stream <X>"
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    You are working on Task #<N> in the epic worktree at: ../epic-<name>/
    
    Your stream: <stream_name>
    Your scope — files to modify: <file_patterns>
    Work to complete: <stream_description>
    
    Instructions:
    1. Read full task from: .claude/epics/<epic>/<N>.md
    2. Read analysis from: .claude/epics/<epic>/<N>-analysis.md
    3. Work ONLY in your assigned files
    4. Commit frequently: "Task #<N>: <specific change>"
    5. Update progress in: .claude/epics/<epic>/updates/<N>/stream-<X>.md
    6. If you need to touch files outside your scope, note it in your progress file and wait
    7. Never use --force on git operations
    
    Complete your stream's work and mark status: completed when done.
```

Streams with unmet dependencies are queued — launch them as their dependencies complete.

**Step 4 — Update status in Lark Base:**
```bash
APP_TOKEN=$(grep 'app_token:' .claude/lark-ccpm.yml | awk '{print $2}')
TABLE_ID=$(grep 'table_id:' .claude/lark-ccpm.yml | awk '{print $2}')
RECORD_ID=$(grep 'lark_record:' .claude/epics/*/<N>.md | awk '{print $2}')
lark-cli base +record-upsert --base-token "$APP_TOKEN" --table-id "$TABLE_ID" --record-id "$RECORD_ID" --json '{"状态":"In Progress"}'
```

**Step 5 — Create execution status file** at `.claude/epics/<epic>/updates/<N>/execution.md`:
```markdown
## Active Streams
- Stream A: <name> — Started <time>
- Stream B: <name> — Started <time>

## Queued
- Stream C: <name> — Waiting on Stream A

## Completed
(none yet)
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Started work on task #<N>

Launched N agents:
  Stream A: <name> ✓ Started
  Stream B: <name> ✓ Started
  Stream C: <name> ⏸ Waiting (depends on A)

Monitor: check progress in .claude/epics/<epic>/updates/<N>/
Sync updates: "sync task <N>"
```

---

## Starting a Full Epic

**Trigger**: User wants to launch parallel agents across all ready tasks in an epic at once.

### Preflight
- Verify `.claude/epics/<name>/epic.md` exists and has a `lark_record:` field (i.e., it's been synced).
- Check for uncommitted changes: `git status --porcelain` — block if dirty.
- Verify epic branch exists: `git branch -a | grep "epic/<name>"`

### Process

**Step 1 — Read all task files** in `.claude/epics/<name>/`. Parse frontmatter for `status`, `depends_on`, `parallel`.

**Step 2 — Categorize tasks:**
- Ready: status=open, no unmet depends_on
- Blocked: has unmet depends_on
- In Progress: already has an execution file
- Complete: status=closed

**Step 3 — Analyze any ready tasks** that don't have an analysis file yet (run task analysis inline).

**Step 4 — Launch agents** for all ready tasks following the same per-task agent launch pattern above.

**Step 5 — Create/update** `.claude/epics/<name>/execution-status.md` with all active agents and queued tasks.

**Step 6 — As agents complete**, check if blocked tasks are now unblocked and launch those agents.

## Agent Coordination Rules

When multiple agents work in the same worktree simultaneously:

- Each agent works only on files in its assigned stream scope.
- Agents commit frequently with `Task #<N>: <description>` format.
- Before modifying a shared file, check `git status <file>` — if another agent has it modified, wait and pull first.
- Agents sync via commits: `git pull --rebase origin epic/<name>` before starting new file work.
- Conflicts are never auto-resolved — agents report them and pause.
- No `--force` flags ever.

Shared files that commonly need coordination (types, config, package.json) should be handled by one designated stream; others pull after that commit.
